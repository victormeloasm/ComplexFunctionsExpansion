# Complex Number Calculator

This code is a simple complex number calculator implemented in C. It performs various operations on complex numbers, including calculating the square root, raising a complex number to a power, and finding the logarithm of a complex number. The user can choose the operation and input type (real or complex) through the console.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this code, you need a C compiler installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the complex number calculator:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Functionality

The complex number calculator supports the following operations:

1. **Calculate Square Root**: This operation calculates the square root of a given number. The number can be either real or complex.

2. **Calculate Power**: This operation raises a number to a given exponent. The number can be either real or complex.

3. **Calculate Logarithm**: This operation calculates the logarithm of a given number. The number can be either real or complex.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to choose an operation and input type. Follow the instructions provided by the program to enter the required values.

### Operation Selection

Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation:

1. Calculate square root
2. Calculate power
3. Calculate logarithm

### Input Type Selection

Enter the number corresponding to the input type:

1. Real
2. Complex

### Entering Values

Depending on the selected input type, enter the appropriate values:

- **Real Number**: If the input type is real, enter a real number when prompted.

- **Complex Number**: If the input type is complex, enter the real and imaginary parts of the complex number when prompted.

### Output

After performing the selected operation, the program will display the result on the console.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the complex number calculator:

```
Choose the operation:
1. Calculate square root
2. Calculate power
3. Calculate logarithm
2

Choose the input type:
1. Real
2. Complex
2

Enter the real part: 2
Enter the imaginary part: 3

Enter the exponent: 4
2.000000 + 3.000000i raised to 4 is -46.000000 + 9.000000i
```
